# Useful_SQL_code
Some collection of useful SQL code.
The most of them are not mine/
I've just collected it for many years.
Some code is odd and looks awful, because it was developed for MS SQL 2000, and a lot of tricks we used in the past now are realized in new version of SQL serve by Microsoft.
But could be interesting to compare with modern features .
Enjoy ;)
