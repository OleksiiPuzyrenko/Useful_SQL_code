# Useful_SQL_code
<B>Some collection of useful SQL code.</B>

  The most of them are not mine. I've just collected it for many years.<br>
Some code is odd and looks awful, because it was developed for MS SQL 2000,
and a lot of tricks we used in the past now are realized in new version of SQL server by Microsoft.<br>
But could be interesting to compare with modern features .

<b>Enjoy ;)   </b>
